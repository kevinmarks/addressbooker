<p>... aims to be a swiss-army knife for contact
management, but right now doesn't do very much.</p>

<p>Currently it can just take a submitted form POST w/ JSON contacts
data and either export a vCard file (for OS X or whatever), and/or
merge that submitted data into your Google Contacts (for use in GMail,
Android, etc.).  See the <a href="http://brad.livejournal.com/2398409.html">announcement blog post</a>.
</p>

<p>To submit data, use <a href="/form">use this form</a> or do a POST
to <code>http://unmung.appspot.com/submit</code> with the following parameters:</p>
<blockquote>
<table border='1' cellpadding='5' cellspacing='1'>
<tr valign='top'><td><tt>group</tt></td><td>Optional group name to put contacts in.  Not required.</td></tr>
<tr valign='top'><td><tt>handle</tt></td><td>Some self-assigned handle for the data you're submitted.  Pick something long and random.  Must match regexp <code>\w+</code>.  This is used if the user isn't logged in and the submitted contacts need to be stashed away with a key for awhile, during the Google sign-in/OAuth/Authsub redirect dance.</td></tr>
<tr valign='top'><td><tt>json</tt></td><td>Portable Contacts format like: <pre>{
"entry":[
 {
   "displayName": "Brad Fitzpatrick",
   "phoneNumbers": [
      { "type": "Mobile", "value": "555-1212"},
      { "type": "Home", "value": "555-1313"},
   ],
 },
 {
   "displayName": "Kevin Marks",
   "phoneNumbers": [
      { "type": "Mobile", "value": "555-1414"},
      { "type": "Home", "value": "555-1515"},
   ],
 },
]
}</pre>

<p>(sorry, email addresses not supported yet: just names and numbers.)</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> <s>Joseph Smarr brought to my attention that this should
be using the <a href="http://portablecontacts.net/">Portable
Contacts</a> JSON format instead and I agree.  It's a tiny change.
I'll do that first free chance I get.  Or patches welcome.</s> done by Kevin Marks</p>

<p>When merging with your Google Contacts, it'll try to smartly merge
into existing contacts if possible (matching on name, phone number),
only creating new contacts as a last resort.</p>
